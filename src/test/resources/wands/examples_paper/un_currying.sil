/* This example shows how our approach to magic wands can be used to
 * prove the property
 *
 *   A * B --* C   <==>   A --* B --* C
 *
 * We prove both directions independently, both proofs require nested
 * ghost operations. In the "<==" case (method uncurry()) we get to
 * assume the hypothetical LHS A * B while showing the overall wand
 * A * B --* C, and we can therefore subsequently apply the outer and
 * inner wand that we were given (A --* B --* C), which suffices to
 * show the RHS C.
 *
 * The "==>" case is more involved. An initial idea might be to
 * package the inner wand B --* C first, followed by the outer wand
 * A --* B --* C. However, the sequence of statements
 *   package B --* C
 *   package A --* B --* C
 * is doomed to fail because, given only the hypothetical state B, we
 * won't be able to show C in the first statement (note that we
 * cannot apply A * B --* C to get C, because we lack A).
 * The solution is using a packaging-expression nested into a package
 * statement, which yields two hypothetical states (the first
 * satisfying A, the second B), which in turn enables us to apply the
 * given wand A * B --* C.
