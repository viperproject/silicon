    // the implications of the their values on the assertion from above (the 
    // one after the apply statement; ignoring x.f):
    //    
    //     b' | b'' | assertion
    //   -----------------------------------
    //     t  |  t  | acc(x.h) * acc(x.g)

    // we are now again in a state where we hold permissions to all three
    // fields.
