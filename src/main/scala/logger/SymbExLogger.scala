/**
  * ================================
  * SymbExLogger Usage
  * ================================
  * The SymbExLogger has to be enabled by passing `--ideModeAdvanced` to Silicon (which in turn
  * requires numberOfParallelVerifiers to be 1).
  * Unless otherwise specified, the default logConfig will be used (viper.silicon.logger.LogConfig.default()):
  * All logged records will be included in the report, but store, heap, and path conditions will be omitted.
  *
  * A custom logConfig can be used by passing `--logConfig <pathToLogConfig>` to Silicon. The logConfig has to be valid
  * JSON in the following format:
  * {
  *   "isBlackList": false,
  *   "includeStore": false,
  *   "includeHeap": false,
  *   "includeOldHeap": false,
  *   "includePcs": false,
  *   "recordConfigs": [
  *     {
  *       "kind": "method"
  *     },
  *     {
  *       "kind": "execute",
  *       "value": "a := 1"
  *     }
  *   ]
  * }
  *
  * isBlackList: specifies whether recordConfigs should be interpreted as a black- or whitelist
  * includeStore: specifies whether store information for each record (that offers it) should be included
  * includeHeap: specifies whether heap information for each record (that offers it) should be included
  * includeOldHeap: specifies whether old heap information for each record (that offers it) should be included
  * includePcs: specifies whether path condition information for each record (that offers it) should be included
  * recordConfigs: array of recordConfig
  * recordConfig.kind: string with which each SymbolicRecord.toTypeString() is matched against
  * recordConfig.value: optional string with which each SymbolicRecord.toSimpleString() is matched against
  *
  * Therefore, the above example leads to the following logger behavior:
  * - No store, heap, old heap, and path condition information will be present in the report
  * - By interpreting recordConfigs as whitelist, all records of type MethodRecord will be included in the report as
  *   well as any ExecuteRecord with statement "a := 1" (all other ExecuteRecords will be omitted)
  */

/*
 * ================================
 * SymbExLogger Architecture
 * ================================
 * Overall concept:
 * 1) SymbExLogger Object:
 *    Is used as interface to access the logs. Code from this file that is used in Silicon
 *    should only be used via SymbExLogger. Contains a list of SymbLog, one SymbLog
 *    per method/function/predicate (member). The method 'currentLog()' gives access to the log
 *    of the currently executed member.
 * 2) SymbLog:
 *    Contains the log for a member. Most important methods: openScope/closeScope/insertBranchPoint. To 'start'
 *    a record use openScope, to finish the recording use closeScope. For each execution path, there should be a
 *    closeScope for each openScope. Due to branching this means that there might be multiple closeScopes for a
 *    openScope, because the scope has to be closed on each branch. However to support verification failures, the log
 *    does not have to be complete. In case of a missing close scope record, the scope will be closed immediately
 *    before an outer close scope record.
 * 3) Records:
 *    There are scoping records representing open and close scope in the log. These records will be automatically
 *    inserted in the log by SymbExLogger depending on other records.
 *    Structural records represent branching and joining in the resulting log. JoiningRecords are inserted as regular
 *    data records, BranchingRecords are inserted using the special interface (insertBranchPoint, markReachable,
 *    switchToNextBranch, and endBranchPoint).
 *    Data records represent symbolic primitives (execute, evalute, consume, produce) as well as executions of some
 *    algorithms of the symbolic execution engine. Inserting a data record automatically creates a scope for it. Each
 *    subsequent log entry is assumped to be in the scope until scopeClose is invoked.
 *
 *    Example to illustrate the way a silver program is logged:
 *    Assume the following silver code:
 *
 *    method m() {
 *      var a: Int
 *      a := 1
 *      a := a+2
 *    }
 *
 *    This results in a log that can be visualized as a
 *    simple tree (see: SimpleTreeRenderer) as follows:
 *
 *    method m
 *      WellformednessCheck null
 *      execute var a: Int
 *      execute a := 1
 *        evaluate 1
 *      execute a := a + 2
 *        evaluate a + 2
 *          evaluate a
 *          evaluate 2
 *
 *    The order of insert/collapse is as follows:
 *    openScope(method m),
 *    openScope(WellformednessCheck null), closeScope(WellformednessCheck null),
 *    openScope(execute var a), closeScope(execute var a), openScope(execute a := 1), openScope(evaluate 1),
 *    closeScope(evaluate 1), closeScope(execute a := 1),
 *    openScope(execute a := a + 2), openScope(evaluate a + 2), openScope(evaluate a) closeScope(evaluate a),
 *    openScope(evaluate 2), closeScope(evaluate 2), closeScope(evaluate a + 2), closeScope(execute a := a + 2),
 *    closeScope(method m)
 *
 *    CloseScope basically 'removes one indentation', i.e., brings you one level higher in the tree.
 */

/**
  * ================================
  * GUIDE FOR ADDING RECORDS TO SymbExLogger
  * ================================
  *
  * SymbExLogger records calls to several symbolic primitives (execute, evalute, produce, consume) as well as algorithms
  * of Silicon. By default, only the current state, context and parameters of the primitives are stored (if configured
  * in logConfig).
  * If you want to get more information from certain structures, there are several ways to store additional
  * info:
  *
  * 1) Store the information as a CommentRecord.
  * 2) Implement a customized record.
  *
  * Use of CommentRecord (1):
  * At the point in the code where you want to add the comment, call
  * //val id = SymbExLogger.currentLog().openScope(new CommentRecord(my_info, σ, c)
  * //SymbExLogger.currentLog().closeScope(id)
  * σ is the current state (AnyRef, but should be of type State[_,_,_] usually), my_info
  * is a string that contains the information you want to store, c is the current
  * context. If you want to store more information than just a string, consider (2).
  *
  * Use of custom Records (2):
  * For already existing examples of data records, have look at records/data. In particular ProverAssertRecord might be
  * of interested, because it shows how additional info can be stored and inserted into RecordData during report
  * creation.
  * Inserting new structure records might be a bit more involved, depending on the use case.
  * As an example, the joining (e.g. occurring in pure conditional expressions) is discussed next:
  * Silicon uses Joiner to join execution after an execution block. A JoiningRecord is created at the beginning of the
  * Joiner and added to the log by calling:
  * // val uidJoin = SymbExLogger.currentLog().openScope(joiningRecord)
  * After executing the block and joining the execution, the following call to the SymbExLogger is made to close the
  * join scope:
  * // SymbExLogger.currentLog().closeScope(uidJoin)
  * Although JoiningRecord is a structural record and joining in symbolic execution has significant impact on the
  * execution structure, JoiningRecord behalves almost as a data record in SymbExLogger:
  * Due to the design that each data record (and joining record) causes a scope and the scope contains all
  * subexpressions, it naturally follows that branching records and their branches inside a join scope will be joined
  * because they are part of join's scope and the scope eventually ends.
  * Hence, of more interest is branching (which most likely occurs in every join scope):
  * If the execution is branched (occurs in Brancher as well as in Executor when following more than one branch) the
  * logger has to be informed about it in order that records on the individual branches are correctly logged.
  * To do so, the following call creates a new branch point with a number of branches that result out of it (but aren't
  * necessarily all reachable):
  * // val uidBranchPoint = SymbExLogger.currentLog().insertBranchPoint(2, Some(condition))
  * All records that will subsequently be inserted will be assigned to the first branch.
  * As soon as the execution of the first branch is complete, the logger needs to switch to the next branch:
  * // SymbExLogger.currentLog().switchToNextBranch(uidBranchPoint)
  * When the execution of all branches is done, the branch point is concluded:
  * // SymbExLogger.currentLog().endBranchPoint(uidBranchPoint)
  * Because the existence as well as non-existence of records on a branch does not imply reachability, the logger
  * needs to be explicitly informed for each branch that is reachable:
  * // SymbExLogger.currentLog().markReachable(uidBranchPoint)
