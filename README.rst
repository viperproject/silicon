Silicon is a symbolic-execution-based verifier for the `Silver <https://bitbucket.org/viperproject/silver>`_ intermediate verification language (IVL), which is an IVL in the spirit of Microsoft's Boogie, but with a higher level of abstraction that is more suited for permission-based verification of programs with shared mutable state. Silver is based on the logic of implicit dynamic frames; it supports fractional permissions, heap-dependent abstraction functions, quantifiers, and mathematical sets and sequences. See `this technical report <http://pm.inf.ethz.ch/publications/getpdf.php?bibname=Own&id=JKMNSS14.pdf>`_ on Silver for more information.
